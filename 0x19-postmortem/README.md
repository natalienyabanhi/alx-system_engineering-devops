**Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Project Outage**

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: 2024-03-15 09:30 AM SAST
  - End Time: 2024-03-15 11:45 AM SAST

- **Impact:**
  - The outage affected the user authentication service, causing a complete halt in user login functionality.
  - Users experienced login failures, leading to a 20% decrease in user activity during the outage.

- **Root Cause:**
  - The root cause was identified as an issue in the authentication microservice, specifically a misconfiguration that resulted in the rejection of valid user credentials.

**Timeline:**

- **09:30 AM SAST:**
  - Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in authentication errors.

- **09:35 AM SAST:**
  - Engineering team receives automated alert notifications.

- **09:40 AM SAST:**
  - Initial investigation begins, focusing on recent code deployments and server logs.
  - Assumption: Recent code changes might have introduced a bug affecting authentication.

- **10:00 AM SAST:**
  - Debugging path taken: Initially assumed the issue was related to a database connection error.
  - Investigation expanded to check database health and connections.

- **10:30 AM SAST:**
  - No issues found with the database. Misleading path identified.
  - Escalation to the DevOps team for further infrastructure analysis.

- **11:00 AM SAST:**
  - DevOps identifies misconfiguration in the authentication microservice.
  - Incident escalated to the microservices development team.

- **11:30 AM SAST:**
  - Issue resolved by correcting the misconfiguration in the authentication microservice.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:**
  - Misconfiguration in the authentication microservice caused rejection of valid user credentials.

- **Resolution:**
  - Corrected the misconfiguration by updating the authentication microservice configuration files.
  - Deployed the corrected configuration to the production environment.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Things to Improve/Fix:**
  - Strengthen monitoring: Enhance monitoring alerts to provide more specific details on the nature of authentication failures.
  - Automated testing: Implement automated tests for configuration settings during the deployment process.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. **Update Monitoring System:** Improve monitoring alerts to include detailed information about the type of authentication errors.
  2. **Documentation Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of system documentation to ensure accurate configuration settings are documented.
  3. **Automated Configuration Checks:** Implement automated checks during the deployment process to verify the correctness of configuration settings.
  4. **User Communication Protocol:** Establish a clear communication protocol for informing users about ongoing outages and resolutions.

In conclusion, the outage was efficiently addressed through a systematic investigation that led to the identification and correction of a misconfiguration in the authentication microservice. The incident highlighted the importance of robust monitoring, swift escalation procedures, and automated configuration checks to prevent similar issues in the future. The outlined corrective and preventative measures aim to fortify the system against potential misconfigurations and enhance overall system resilience.
